      <h2>About Saarthi</h2>
      <p>
        Saarthi Knowledge Center is an organization dedicated to empowering students and young professionals through education and skill development. Our mission is to provide accessible, high-quality learning resources that inspire and equip individuals to achieve their full potential.
      <p>
        The word 'Saarthi' comes from the reference of Mahabharata. It primarily means charioteer. In the battle of Mahabharata, Krishna becomes the charioteer of Arjuna, who is gone timid and lost his confidance in the battlefield. Similarly, Saarthi as an organization aims to be the guiding light in the lives of students, young professionals, and anyone who has the zeal and passion for continuous learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        We provide curriculum and courses for school and college students in both technical and non-technical streams. Saarthi also helps young job seekers prepare with essential employability training including Software Development, Soft Skills, Public Speaking, and Leadership.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our team consists of experienced educators, industry professionals, and passionate volunteers who are committed to making a difference in the lives of learners. We believe that education is a powerful tool for personal and societal transformation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Join us on our journey to create a brighter future through knowledge and learning. Together, we can make a significant impact in the lives of individuals and communities.
